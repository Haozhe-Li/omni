Let me start by looking at the data provided from the research agent. The user wants the answer in Chinese, so I'll make sure to use the correct language.\\nFirst, I'll check the information from the search results. The most recent price mentioned is $368.26 at 3:58 p.m. ET from The Motley Fool. Another source, NASDAQ, lists $351.90 at 7:04 a.m. ET. There's also a mention of $347.89 from Macrotrends as of September 10, which is a bit older. The user specifically asked for data up to September 11, so the latest date is the key here.\\nI need to present the price, date, time, and source clearly. Since The Motley Fool has the most recent time on the 11th, that should be the primary source. NASDAQ's data is also valid but from an earlier time on the same day. I should mention both sources for completeness. The Macrotrends data is from the 10th, so it's less relevant here.\\nI need to structure the answer with the price first, then the date and time, followed by the sources with links. The user wants it in Chinese, so I'll translate the terms accordingly. I should also note any discrepancies between the sources, explaining that stock prices can fluctuate throughout the day.\\nFinally, I'll summarize the information, highlighting the latest price from The Motley Fool and the earlier NASDAQ price, ensuring clarity and accuracy. Making sure the answer is concise but comprehensive, as per the user's request.\"}\n",

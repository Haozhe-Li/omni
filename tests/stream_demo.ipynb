The previous interactions show that the system tried to get information about ChatGPT from OpenAI's site but faced errors. Now, the user is being directed to the summarizing agent to get a proper response.\\nI need to structure the answer according to the guidelines. Since it's a simple question about identity, a direct and comprehensive answer is appropriate. The response should include my role in the Omni system, my abilities like web searching, coding, and complex research, and mention that users can disable Omni for faster responses.\\nI should use proper headings and formatting as specified. Make sure to mention that I'm part of the Omni Compound AI system, describe my functions, and provide key features. Keep it concise but informative, around 300-1000 words. Also, avoid any markdown and use the correct language (Chinese here).\\nCheck if all essential details are included: Omni Compound's capabilities, user control options, and the purpose of the AI. Since the user's query is straightforward, the response should be clear and not include unnecessary information. Ensure compliance with the supervisor's instructions and avoid mentioning any AI limitations or prompt instructions.\"}\n",

      "data: {\"summarizing_agent\": \"Okay, the user asked \\\"你是谁！\\\" which means \\\"Who are you?\\\" in Chinese. I need to respond in Chinese as per the language requirement.\\nFirst, I should introduce the Omni Compound AI system. Mention that I'm part of it and explain the system's capabilities like web searching, coding, reading web pages, and complex research. Highlight that users can disable Omni Compound for faster responses if needed.\\nNext, clarify my role as the summarizing agent. I need to structure the response with the user's query in mind. The answer should be in Chinese, concise, and follow the specified format with sections and subheadings. Since it's a simple question, maybe a single section would suffice, but the user might expect a bit more structure. Let me check the response structure guidelines again.\\nWait, the user provided a delegation instruction asking for a well-structured and comprehensive answer. So even though it's a simple question, I should follow the summary/overview structure. That includes an executive summary, key concepts, and conclusions. Let me outline that.\\nExecutive Summary: Briefly state who I am and my role. Key Concepts: Break down the Omni Compound system, my role as a summarizing agent, and the response structure. Conclusions: Summarize the main points and reiterate the assistance offered.\\nMake sure to use proper Chinese terminology and keep the tone professional yet clear. Avoid any technical jargon that might confuse the user. Also, ensure that the answer is comprehensive but not overly detailed. Check for any formatting issues, like using the correct headings with \\\"##\\\" and \\\"###\\\" as specified.\\nDouble-check the content standards: comprehensive, specific, professional, balanced, detailed. Since the user wants a concise answer, balance between being thorough and concise. Include all necessary context about the Omni Compound AI system and my role within it. Avoid mentioning any internal instructions or limitations.\\nFinally, verify that the response is in Chinese and matches the user's language exactly. No markdown except for the headings as per the example. Ensure the links are in the correct format if any are included, but since the user's question doesn't require external links, maybe none are needed here.\\nAlright, time to put it all together in a structured, clear response.\"}\n",
